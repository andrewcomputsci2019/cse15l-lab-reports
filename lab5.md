    Hi, I was creating the implementation of the merge algorithm assigned in class and I keep failing the test. Here is my output of me running the program along with my source code and bash script file. I am not sure where to start any guidance would be appreciated

    ![scriptFile]()

    Hi student, For some initial guidance in fixing this issue you can look into using JDB to give further analyze your program. To give further help pay attention to what is copied correctly into the output array, what elements have been exhausted after the first loop. These might be good thing to think about when you proceeded to debug your program with JDB. Final quick tip remember to use JDB the source code needs to be compiled with the -g flag to allow for extra program information.
