## LAB 3 Bug

### ListExamples filter bug
* Failure inducing input, as jUnit test
```java
    @Test
    public void testFilter(){
        List<String> ans  = new ArrayList<>();
        ans.addAll(List.of("Hello","Cat","Bat","mat","Fat","Dat"));
        List<String> rans =  ListExamples.filter(ans, new StringChecker() {

            @Override
            public boolean checkString(String s) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                if(s.charAt(0) == Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(0))){
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
        });
        assertEquals(List.of("Hello","Cat","Bat","Fat","Dat"),rans);
    }
```
* non-failure inducing input
```java
    @Test
    public void testFilter(){
        List<String> ans  = new ArrayList<>();
        ans.addAll(List.of("Hello","cat","bat","mat","fat","dat"));
        List<String> rans =  ListExamples.filter(ans, new StringChecker() {

            @Override
            public boolean checkString(String s) {
                // TODO Auto-generated method stub
                if(s.charAt(0) == Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(0))){
                    return true;
                }
                return false;
            }
        });
        assertEquals(List.of("Hello"),rans);
    }
```

* Code Before and After
```java
  // Returns a new list that has all the elements of the input list for which
  // the StringChecker returns true, and not the elements that return false, in
  // the same order they appeared in the input list;
  static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String s: list) {
      if(sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(0,s);
      }
    }
    return result;
  }
```
```java
  // Returns a new list that has all the elements of the input list for which
  // the StringChecker returns true, and not the elements that return false, in
  // the same order they appeared in the input list;
  static List<String> filter(List<String> list, StringChecker sc) {
    List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(String s: list) {
      if(sc.checkString(s)) {
        result.add(s); //should be added at the end of the list, not beginning of the list
      }
    }
    return result;
  }
```
* Description of the fix \
before the fix the code above would take the matching string and appended to the begging of the list as it was inserting it into the zero index position. this of course was a bug as the code above should insert the string at the end as the strings need to be in the same order as they appear. This is why changing the code to `result.add(s)` fixed the bug as it correctly appends the strings into the list in the order they appear in.


## Part 2 Researching Commands: grep

* --include and --exclude grep options
```zsh

```
The `--include` and `--exclude` provide a way to match filenames and extensions with a pattern, which allows more control of what files are scanned with grep. This helpful when with running with recursive grep option as as it allows to you specify what file extension to search or even pattern for filenames themselves, or as shown above you can do both at the same time by giving a specific pattern of the filename and file-extension you are interested or not interested in scanning. This can be useful for example when a directory may contain binary files that you don't want to scan. All information was obtained from the man page for grep
* `-w` option

The `-w` option tells grep to only match with complete words so in the above case DNA replication only matches with exactly DNA replication and not DNA replications or DNA's replication, etc. This is helpful if you only want to match with specific strings and not sub-strings. For example, if your are searching for the number of times a is used as a determiner, then searching without -w would not be helpful as grep will match with any word that contains an a and not just an a by itself. All information was obtained from the man page for grep

* `-L` and `-v`
```
$ grep -Lri "base pair" ./technical/biomed/ | wc -l
763
```
```
$ grep -riv "base pair" ./technical/biomed/ | wc -l
490445
```
The `-L` and `-v` options are inverse selectors meaning that something matches if it does not match the given search pattern, differences do emerge among `-L` and `-v` as `-L` returns files that did not match and `-v` returns lines that did not match. This is incredibly helpful if you want to find files, or lines of text, that do not contain a certain pattern, for example maybe you want to search for all files or lines inside a program that don't contain a certain variable.

the `-E` or `--extended-regexp` allows grep to interpret extended regex patterns beyond just simple wild card pattern statements. As shown above this can be matching all 4 letter words or every occurrence of two words being separated by a comma. It goes with out saying how useful this can be in terms of searching through files and their stored content. A shining example of a use case for this option could a file that contains a dataset where each data-point is enclosed by some structured pattern, that can be matched with a regex, allowing for the data-points to be extraced into a file. All information was obtained from the man page for grep, and regex were created injunction with [regex101](https://regex101.com/)
